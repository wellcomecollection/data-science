# :microscope: Data Science

This repo contains the data science work being carried out on Wellcome
Collection. The work is divided into four major sections:

### [Research](./research)

Turning ideas from research papers into usable code. Lots of notebooks, lots of
documentation of the problem to be solved and how the corresponding solution has
developed.

### [APIs](./apis)

Demo APIs/interfaces crystalising the ideas from the research stage. These demo
apis allow us to explore what a production service might look like and what kind
of user experience it might facilitate.

### [Services](./services)

Full services running in the pipeline, transforming and enhancing source data.

### [Infrastructure](./infrastructure)

Code that facilitates all of the above, including a research environment for
jupyter notebooks shared across flexible CPU/GPU hardware. That research
environment is controlled by [HAL](./infrastructure/hal).

### [Jupyter](./jupyter/README.md)

Infrastructure to run jupyter in AWS.
