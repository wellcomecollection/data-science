# `get_images`

Takes a wellcome work ID (eg `n43aqrgd`) and downloads all of the digitised pages as images. These are stored in `data/images/{WORK_ID}`.

As all images are given a base name of `default.jpg` by IIIF, the images are saved with a file name generated by the sha256 hash of the source urls. A json ledger records the correspondence between the images' file names and their source urls.
